I have finally earned my bachelors degree and I could not be happier.
My thesis "Large Scale Scanning of Session Ticket Confusion" is now available at https://doi.org/10.17619/UNIPB/1-1770, so check it out if you are interested!

For the time being, I am a Research Intern at [CISPA](https://cispa.de) until I can start my Masters in October.
Be prepared for some big things (hopefully!)
