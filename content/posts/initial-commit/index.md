I've been renting this webserver for a while now, but haven't really done anything with it.

This is ought to change now: A friend introduced me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

After finding this nice template I've decided to try to blog a little and just have a place on the internet to dump random stuff.

Cheers!
