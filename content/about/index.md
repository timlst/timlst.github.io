I am currently a research intern at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), the Helmholtz Center for Information Security.
Before that, I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from [Paderborn University](https://uni-paderborn.de).  
My interests are in applied security research: Previously I have worked on TLS security, but currently I am exploring fuzzing for network protocols in the Holz group at CISPA.  
In my freetime I enjoy baking pizza, sauna, anime and indoor plants. Also avid vim user.
This website is a place for me to write about stuff I am interested in.
