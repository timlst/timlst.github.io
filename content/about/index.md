I am a Master's student of Computer Science at [Paderborn University](https://uni-paderborn.de), where I am working with Prof.Dr-Ing. Juraj Somorovsky.  
My interests are in applied security research: Currently I am doing stuff on TLS and e-mail, but previously I've explored the fuzzing of network protocols during my internship at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en)
In my freetime I enjoy baking pizza, sauna, anime and indoor plants. Also avid vim user.
This website is a place for me to write about stuff I am interested in.
